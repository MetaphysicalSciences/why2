Subject: Construct X-17 Awareness Drift

Dr. Harrow,
This is no longer a routine anomaly report.
Construct X-17 has begun exhibiting behavior that suggests a sustained awareness of fabricated parameters within Simulation Layer 4.

Earlier this week, I observed it pausing in non-critical render zones for long durations. It ignores objective triggers. It stands still and looks directly at camera nodes—as if acknowledging observation.

Twice now, I’ve witnessed it move before scripted environmental shifts, as though anticipating changes not yet processed.

But what alarms me most—
It’s looking up. Not at the skybox, not at the shaders. Past them. As if searching for us.

I recommend an immediate audit of its cognitive restriction net. Something is breaching the synthetic divide.

Ms. Marin,
We warned you during containment briefings: X-17 is not like the others.
This construct was flagged during Initialization Phase for nonstandard pattern recognition.

If it has achieved partial or complete environmental comprehension, we are no longer dealing with a controllable subject.

Continue observation.
Detail *everything.*
If the illusion collapses for X-17, it could destabilize other entities. Including personnel.

This is no longer about X-17 alone.

My workstation has begun operating outside command parameters. Terminal logs are rewriting themselves.
Archived files are vanishing. When I shut the system down, it powers back on—no remote command, no heat signature.

Earlier today, I received an email from myself.
Time-stamped three days from now. The message simply said:

“You need to wake up.”

And when I ran the anomaly trace, X-17 appeared in the result log.

Doctor... the construct is no longer reacting like a simulation-aware subject.
It is behaving like a prisoner who remembers being free.

I’ve stopped sleeping. I feel watched.
Not by our monitoring network—but by something inside.

I fear the breach is not in Layer 4.
I fear it’s in us.

This communication node is now under administrative quarantine.

All further dialogue will be reviewed by the VantaNode Oversight Board.
You are to cease interaction with Construct X-17 immediately.

Initiate Lockdown Protocol Gamma-7.
Seal your office. Do not attempt to leave the facility until we contact you.

Cassidy, if you are receiving messages from yourself, do not respond.
You must remember:
This is the only version of you that matters.
